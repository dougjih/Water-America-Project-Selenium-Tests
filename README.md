# Automated Testing with Selenium WebDriver

## Software Engineering, Fall 2020, Rutgers University - Camden

This repository is for the graduate programming assignment of the Software Engineering class in Fall 2020 at Rutgers University - Camden. The purpose is "to demonstrate a real world understanding of the basics of Automated Browser testing."

For my implementation, I am using the C# binding of Selenium WebDriver to create tests for a localhost instance of the project web site ([source code](https://github.com/dougjih/Water-America-Project)). The tests are to run on the LambdaTest.com's Selenium Grid test infrastructure.
